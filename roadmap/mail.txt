The introduction of the new modules system has been the opportunity to
redesign the implementation of EasyCrypt. This process has started 3
months ago and we are now able to give a coarse roadmap:

 1. February 1st.

  We plan to release a version of EasyCrypt with all the features
  dedicated to writing theories / modules / games and their
  specifications, i.e.

  * The new modules / theories system with all the cloning /
    instantiation mechanisms.
  * The ability to express claims / equivs.

  From this date, we expect users to test the new modules system and
  to report their ``feelings'' about it. This will be the right point
  for users to influence the modules system by reporting, e.g., what
  could be improved and what features the modules system is missing.

  In parallel, we will continue to work on the second release.

 2. March 15th.

  This release focuses on plugging in back the proof system for claims
  / equivs along with the development of a standard library (lists,
  maps, bitstrings, modular arithmetic...). The goal is to (at least)
  port back the previous EasyCrypt proof language to the new modules
  system.

  From that release, it should be possible to port your developments
  done on the current release of EasyCrypt.

 3. Documentation (starting from March 15th)

  Starting from the second release, we plan to sync-up the EasyCrypt
  documentation and to write a fresh tutorial. We expect to have a
  preliminary version of the documentation the 15th of May.

 4. Examples database

  We plan to port the current database of working examples. ETA is
  Q3/Q4.

 5. Development tools

  We will sync-up the ProofGeneral plugin.
