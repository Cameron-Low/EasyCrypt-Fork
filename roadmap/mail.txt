The introduction of the new instantiation system has been the
opportunity to rethink EasyCrypt.

Here is our roadmap for this new version of EasyCrypt.

 1. February 1st.

  We plan to release a version of EasyCrypt with all the features
  dedicated to write theories / modules / games and their
  specifications, i.e.

  * The new modules / theories system with all the cloning /
    instantiation mechanisms.
  * The ability to express claims / equivs.

 2. March 15th.

  This release focuses on plugging in back the proof system for claims
  / equivs along with the development of a standard library (lists,
  maps, bitstrings, ...) From that release, it should be possible to
  port your developments done on the current release of EasyCrypt.
