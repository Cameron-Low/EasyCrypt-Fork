We are pleased to release the next milestone for the new easycrypt
system including, along with its bunch of bug fixes, the following
major features:

  - the option to state claims / equivalences / probabilities, along
    with the core mechanism for their why3 translation.

  - an extended standard library that includes definition and related
    theories for scalars (booleans, integers, reals, ...), datatypes
    (words, bitstrings, arrays, lists, maps...), algebraic structures
    (prime fields, cyclic groups).

As for the previous release, the documentation is still to be written
and you should have a look at theories/*.ec and tests/**/*.ec for a
set of examples.

We are now heading to integrate the tactics mechanism that forms the
last major missing part for having a working system

As usual, the source code can be downloaded at:

Please note that this milestone is still a preview release dedicated
to the testing of the new easycrypt system. [*]
