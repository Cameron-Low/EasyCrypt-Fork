      <p>EasyCrypt is a toolset for reasoning about relational properties
      of probabilistic computations with adversarial code. Its main
      application is the construction and verification of game-based
      cryptographic proofs. EasyCrypt can also be used for reasoning
      about (vanilla, approximate, and computational) differential
      privacy.</p>
    
      <p>EasyCrypt has been used to prove the security of emblematic
      cryptographic constructions, including the Cramer-Shoup
      cryptosystem, the OAEP padding scheme, the Full Domain Hash
      signature scheme, the Merkle-Damg√•rd hash function design, and the
      CBC block cipher mode of operation.</p>
